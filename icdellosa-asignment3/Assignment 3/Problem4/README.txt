I want you to do Chapter 9 Exercises (Page 289) of the textbook.

Questions: 1, 2, 5, 9, 12

For each question, I want you to have a short mini discussion. The intent is for me to understand your thought process and critical thinking.

Hint:
- For Question 2, you are given an initial outer diameter with the center coordinates. You may use drawCircles(outerDiameter, centerCoordinates) as a function declaration.
- Question 12 is an example of the "Divide and Conquer" technique. Use minimum(int[] data, int first, int last) as a function declaration.

You may answer these questions in any format you want but I'd suggest to be professional about your submission. For example, you may want to consider answering them on a Word document or better yet, LaTex. You could also just write your answers on a piece of paper and convert it to PDF but please make sure your handwriting is eligible!
