PROBLEM STATEMENT:
In this assignment, you will create a data structure from the Stack ADT and use it to evaluate an algebraic expression.

WHAT IS PROVIDED:
- A stack interface (StackInterface.java)
- An incomplete Driver (Driver.java) 


WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
1. Create a Stack data structure (call it MyStack.java) that implements the provided stack interface. You may choose either an array implementation or a linked implementation.
2. Use MyStack to calculate an algebraic expression by first converting an infix to postfix to evaluate. Complete the Driver class.

HINTS:
1. Algorithm to convert infix to postfix is on page 167
2. Algorithm to evaluate a postfix expression is on page 170
