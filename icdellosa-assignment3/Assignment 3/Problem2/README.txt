I want you to do Chapter 7 Exercises (Page 231) and Chapter 8 Exercises (Page 263) of the textbook.

Questions:
- Chapter 7: 3, 4, 5
- Chapter 8: 3, 6, 7, 12

For each question, I want you to have a short mini discussion. The intent is for me to understand your thought process and critical thinking.

You may answer these questions in any format you want but I'd suggest to be professional about your submission. For example, you may want to consider answering them on a Word document or better yet, LaTex. You could also just write your answers on a piece of paper and convert it to PDF but please make sure your handwriting is eligible!
