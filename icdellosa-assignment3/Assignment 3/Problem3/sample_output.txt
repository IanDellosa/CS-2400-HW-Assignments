Create a deque:
 
 
 isEmpty() returns false
 
 Add to front and back of deque to get
 Joe Jess Jim Jill Jane Jerry
 
 Adding Jim to front.
 Adding Jess to front.
 Adding Jill to back.
 Adding Jane to back.
 Adding Joe to front.
 Adding Jerry to back.
 
 isEmpty() returns false
 
 
 
 Testing getFront, getBack, removeFront, removeBack:
 
 Joe is at the front of the deque.
 Jerry is at the back of the deque.
 Joe is removed from the front of the deque.
 Jerry is removed from the back of the deque.
 Jess is at the front of the deque.
 Jane is at the back of the deque.
 
 
 Testing clear:
 
 
 isEmpty() returns true
 
 
 The next calls will throw an exception.
