PROBLEM STATEMENT:
In this assignment, you will complete DoubleEndedList.java that implements the ListInterface as well as an interface called DoubleEndedInterface which represents the list's entries by using a chain of nodes that has both a head reference and a tail reference. Be sure to read through the code and understand the implementation.

WHAT IS PROVIDED:
- A driver class to test your code. You should not modify this file!
- A list interface (ListInterface.java)
- A double ended interface (DoubleEndedInterface.java)
- An incomplete DoubleEndedList class (DoubleEndedList.java)

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
4. Complete the DoubleEndedList class
4. Run the driver and make sure your output is exactly the same as mine (at the bottom of Driver.java)
