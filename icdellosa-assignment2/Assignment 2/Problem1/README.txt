PROBLEM STATEMENT:
In this assignment, you are tasked to implemented a Bag ADT using links.

WHAT IS PROVIDED:
- A driver class to test your code. You should not modify this file!
- A list interface (ListInterface.java)
- An incomplete Profile class (Profile.java)
- An incomplete Profile Manager class (ProfileManager.java)

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
1. Create a Array-based List class (AList.java) that implements the list interface
2. Create a Name (Name.java) POJO (Plain Old Java)
3. Complete the Profile class
4. Complete the ProfileManager class
4. Run the driver and make sure your output is exactly the same as mine (at the bottom of Driver.java)
